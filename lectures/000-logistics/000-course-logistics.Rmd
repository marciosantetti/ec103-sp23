In addition to writing about .hi[economic] issues, what do all of these have .hi-orange[in common]?

# A real-world look

<br>

*Data* permeate every area of knowledge.

  - And in Economics, this is no different!

<br><br>

Therefore, this course will combine .hi[theoretical] principles with .hi-orange[real-world] analyses.
